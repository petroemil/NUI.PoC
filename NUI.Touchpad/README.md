# Touchpad v2

When only one finger is down, its only going to move the cursor, no accidental taps or dropping a dragged piece of content because you accidentally ran off the touchpad surface.

Using either the left or right mouse button doesn't require the finger to be lifted (and a "tap" gesture to be made), or an awkward pose to use the physical button on the bottom of the touchpad with your thumb.

As a very first step, I made a pretty raw PoC app to at least build the most basic functionality, to process touch events and detect the different fingers. It's pretty simple stuff, but a well organised codebase to extend.

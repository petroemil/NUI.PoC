# Proof of Concept NUI apps

I made this little project for research purposes. I had a couple of ideas in my head about how we could make the interaction with our devices more natural, more comfortable and at the end of the day, more productive.

## [Touchpad v2](NUI.Touchpad)

My first experiment is a different approach to the touchpad that we all know very well with all of its limitations.

I wanted to design an interaction model that is closer to a real mouse and enables some interactions that were not possible with a touchpad, or if they were, they were a bit awkward.

So, here is the idea: Use the Middle finger as a pointer, and use the Index finger and the Ring finger as left and right buttons.

Below is a very quick demonstration video using the sample app from the repo:

## [AirTouch with Kinect](NUI.Kinect)

Have you ever tried to move the hand cursor on an Xbox? Did it feel natural? Did you have the feeling that you are in control of the situation?

I was thinking, why can't it be simpler, more natural?

So I came up with a different method to show the cursor on the screen where you are pointing at.

Below you can see a quick demonstration video:
 * The cursor has a delay because of the smoothing algorithm, in its raw state it's more responsive, but also more noisy
 * Sorry for the portrait video

## COMING SOON

I will upload some short videos to demonstrate the apps for those who can't or don't want to clone and try them on their own computers.

## COMING LATER

Extensions to the core applications to demonstrate these interaction methods in real world scenarios.

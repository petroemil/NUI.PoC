# Proof of Concept NUI apps

I made this little project for research purposes. I had a couple of ideas in my head about how we could make the interaction with our devices more natural, more comfortable and at the end of the day, more productive.

## [Touchpad v2](NUI.Touchpad)

My first experiment is a different approach to the touchpad that we all know very well with all of its limitations.

I wanted to design an interaction model that is closer to a real mouse and enables some interactions that were not possible with a touchpad, or if they were, they were a bit awkward.

So, here is the idea: Use the Middle finger as a pointer, and use the Index finger and the Ring finger as left and right buttons.

## [AirTouch with Kinect](NUI.Kinect)

Have you ever tried to move the hand cursor on an Xbox? Did it feel natural? Did you have the feeling that you are in control of the situation?

I was thinking, why can't it be simpler, more natural?

So I came up with a different method to show the cursor on the screen where you are pointing at.

## COMING SOON

I will upload some short videos to demonstrate the apps for those who can't or don't want to clone and try them on their own computers.

Extensions to the core applications to demonstrate these interaction methods in real world scenarios.
